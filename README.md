# CS254-Project-ML
1. Our dataset is private so we are not sharing it here 
2. We have divided the code to be run step by step
3. If you have similar dataset you can import the needed libararies first
4. Then walk through and run the code to preprocess the data
5. Then splitting and feature extraction then training and testing using the needed algorithm 
6. We have split the code to have each used algorithm in a box with the evaluation metrics to evaluate on. 
7. Let us know if you want further information to help reproducing the code, we leave comments that will help to reproduce or reuse the code
