# CS254-Project-ML
# Our dataset is private so we are not sharing it here 
# we have divided the code to be run step by step
# if you have similer dataset you can import the needed libararies first
# then walk through and run the code to preprocess the data
# then splitting and feature extraction then training and testing using the needed algorithm 
# we have split the code to have each used algorithm in a box with the evaluation metrics to evaluate on. 
# let us know if you want further information to help reproducing the code.
